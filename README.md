# DeepDream-Algorithm

## In this colab notebook, I use Tensorflow to experiment with AI Art, in specific with the Deep Dream Algorithm. Use it at you wish, try it with your own images! ðŸ™‚
 
### I included some comments to understand what's happening under the hood; Hope you find usefull! ðŸ™Œ

### Important points to mention

- The original file code is too heavy due I ran 7,000 steps with step_size = 0.001, to get a great Deep Dream style image ðŸ˜… :
- So, I'm going to put in #comments the last part of the code where I run the algorithm, to be able to upload the colab here in Github.
- Remember, just remove the #comments in the last part of the algorithm to run on your side. 
- I'm including the original images if you want to run the model with the same images that I used.
